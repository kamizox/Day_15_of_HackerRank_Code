💡 Day 15: Mastering Linked Lists in Java
Today I tackled a classic Data Structures problem:
📌 "Insert a node at the tail of a linked list"

🔧 What I learned:

How to create and link nodes dynamically using Java classes.

Traversing a linked list using a while loop.

Properly handling null (empty list) cases.

👨‍💻 The Challenge:
Given a number of elements, insert them one by one at the end of a singly linked list.

🧠 Lesson:
Linked lists demand careful pointer handling – one wrong move and your list structure collapses. This was great practice in both logic and patience!

✅ Status:
Problem solved and tested! 🔥

📈 Onward to more complex data structures now!
